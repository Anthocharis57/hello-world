## My GitHub Projects

I’m currently busy refreshing and building on my tech skills in preparation for returning to employment. 

Git looks to be pretty much how I remember it from a previous website building project, but I am keen to learn to use GitHub as a collaborative tool. 

I see version control as an important part of project building. An iterative approach enables me to consider alternatives, to reflect and experiment with variations to find the best solution for the end goal, knowing I can safely and easily roll back to a previous point, all whilst simultaneously keeping the main project in its best usable state.  

… I’ll be adding my tech projects here.
